This project is to manage filaments for 3D printing.

Goals:

* RFID tags that can be mounted on the roll, that will store the brand, colour, material and the approx weight of the spool.
* 4 load cells to measure the weight of 4 rolls of filament (currently limited by the 4 available address for the Piicodev RFID modules)
* Individual compartments with heating elements so that 4 different materials can be dried at once, with temp and humidity monitoring
* Intergration into Klipper so that the materials can be monitored via Mainsail
* Self rewind function for loading and unloading
